# World of Darkness & Dungeons & Dragons (WoDnD2)

WoD&D² is a work around the World of Darkness, the storytelling system God-Machine version 2 with a dual goal. First, extract the core rules from the 226 pages of the core rulebook and simplify them to an easy and quick use. Second, extend the rules for applying them to a heroic fantasy universe inspired from Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.

This project, including the website and its content, is an experiment created with Gemini and hosted on github.io.
