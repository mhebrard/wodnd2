# Chapter 1: The Goblin Lair

## The Awakening

The awakening did not arrive as a sudden gasp of life, but as a slow, agonizing siege against the void.

Consciousness returned in fragments, pieced together by the sensations of a body pushed beyond its limits. The first truth was the cold. It was a deep, persistent malice that seeped up from the floor, a chilling dampness that had long ago saturated the survivor's clothes and settled into the marrow of their bones. The stone beneath was unforgiving, a cruel bed of sharp, angular rocks, each ridge and jagged point digging into bruised flesh.

Pain followed the cold, radiating from the base of the skull in a dull, throbbing rhythm that matched the sluggish beat of the heart. Muscles screamed in protest, a chorus of agony that spoke to a struggle lost to memory, a long drag through dark places, the battering of limbs against unyielding stone. It was the ache of total, crushing exhaustion, the feeling of having been discarded like refuse in the dark.

Slowly, with a trembling effort that felt titanic, the figure pried their heavy eyelids open. They were crusted with grit, as if the sleep had lasted an age. Vision returned, but it brought no comfort. The world did not rush in with light; it conceded only shadow.

Above, the ceiling vaulted into an oppressive, swallowing darkness. It was a void so high and absolute that it seemed to possess a weight of its own. Yet, far above, impossibly distant, a single sliver of golden light cut through the gloom. It was a cruel reminder of a world that still existed, a memory of the sun. The lonely ray pierced the vast emptiness, illuminating a lazy, swirling dance of dust motes before splashing onto the cavern floor.

The survivor pushed upright. A wave of vertigo washed over them, tilting the cavern on its axis. A hand slapped against the damp stone to steady the spinning world, a dry, rasping gasp escaping lungs that felt lined with sandpaper. The tongue was a swollen, foreign object in the mouth. Thirst. It was not merely a desire; it was a screaming, biological imperative that cut through the mental fog, demanding immediate obedience.

In the silence, magnified by the ringing in their ears, a sound emerged.

Plink… plink… plink.

The figure froze, head snapping toward the noise. There, along the far wall, a thin trickle of water wept from a fissure in the rock. It crawled down the slime-slicked stone face, gathering in a small, dark depression in the floor. To desperate eyes, it shimmered with the brilliance of a diamond.

They began to crawl. Limbs were stiff, uncooperative things, moving with the jerky coordination of a marionette. One hand forward, then a knee, scraping over the loose gravel. The promise of moisture on cracked lips drove the body forward, suppressing the pain. The hand reached out, fingers trembling, inches from the life-giving pool.

CLANK.

The movement halted with a violent, jarring snap. The crawler was yanked backward, a sharp, cold pressure biting deep into their ankle.

Panic, cold and sharp, flooded the chest. They looked down. Encircling the leg was a heavy, pitted iron shackle, its surface coarse with rust. A thick, grimy chain snaked from the iron cuff, dragging across the stone floor before disappearing into the shadows, terminating at a massive iron bolt driven deep into the opposing wall.

The reality of the situation crashed down. This was no accident. This was a prison.

Wide eyes, now fueled by the adrenaline of the hunted, darted around the small cavern with frantic attention. There were others, two chains bolted to the same wall, lying limp and empty in the dirt. Near them, scattered like discarded toys, were bones. Stark white against the dark earth, picked clean and bleached by the slow passage of time. A fragment of a ribcage here, a slender femur there. The silent, grim testament to the fates of predecessors.

The survivor’s gaze swung to the only break in the suffocating stone walls. A low, narrow tunnel, barely tall enough for a man to stoop through. It was the throat of the mountain, the only way out. But hope died there, too. The passage was sealed by a crude gate of thick, uneven iron bars, driven directly into the bedrock. They were ancient and pitted, but solid, mocking any thought of a quick escape.

The survivor slumped back against the cold wall, the adrenaline fading into a cold dread. Their gaze fell upon a glint near their feet. A shard of dark, reflective glass lay in the dirt. They picked it up, the edges sharp against a numb thumb.

They hesitated. The fog in the mind was frustratingly dense. Who were they? How had they come to be chained in the heart of the mountain? The darkness held no answers, only the echo of ragged breathing.

Slowly, the survivor tilted the shard into the single ray of sunlight. They stared into the reflection.

The face that stared back was a stranger’s, yet disturbingly familiar. It was the only truth left. They scrutinized the features in the crude mirror, searching for an anchor.

And the eyes… How many winters had they seen? Were they wide with the raw, reckless energy of youth? Did they hold the steady, measured gaze of an adult in their prime? Or were they clouded with the weary, cynical wisdom of one who had seen too much?

The survivor lowered the shard. In the corner of the cell lay the meager tools of captivity: a rough-hewn wooden bowl, empty and stained, and a cracked earthenware cup.

Alone. Cold. Hungry. Chained to the dark heart of the world. But alive. And as long as breath rattled in the chest, there was a choice to be made.

The water was just out of reach. The chain was taut. The thirst was a fire.

:::rolls
Action Required:

Option 1 The Test of Might Strategy: The chain is rusted, or perhaps the bolt in the wall is loose. The survivor ignores the pain, coils their muscles, and throws their entire body weight against the restraint. Mechanics: Roll Strength + Athletics (7d10, 7+). Difficulty: 3 Successes required due to the durability of iron.

Option 2 The Scavenger’s Eye Strategy: Brute force wastes energy they do not have. They calm their breathing and scour the floor within their radius, looking for a bone splinter to pick the lock or using the jagged glass shard to dig out the mortar around the wall bolt. Mechanics: Roll Intelligence + Larceny (7d10, 7+). Difficulty: 2 Successes required.

Option 3 The Tactician's Assessment Strategy: Before risking injury or wasting tools, the survivor studies the cage. They examine the uneven iron bars of the tunnel gate for rust spots, measure the reach of the chain against the room's layout, and analyze the debris for anything that could be used as a lever or a hook to bypass the locks. Mechanics: Roll Wits + Investigation (7d10, 7+). Difficulty: 2 Successes required to find a structural flaw or a hidden advantage.
