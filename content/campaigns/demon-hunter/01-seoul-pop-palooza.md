# Seoul-Pop-Palooza

The sun has just dipped below the horizon, turning the sky into a deep, electric twilight blue. It’s the perfect time for the "Seoul-Pop-Palooza" to shine! The massive main stage is a towering masterpiece of steel trusses and dazzling lights, blasting beams of pink, teal, and lime green high into the air.

Huge LED screens span the width of the stage, pulsing with colorful abstract graphics that move to the beat of the music. The energy here is electric! Down in the front, the food vendors aren't just trucks, they are sleek, retro-futuristic vehicles outlined in glowing neon tubes, serving up treats under bright signs that say "FOOD TRUCKS" and "VENDOR".

The crowd is a sea of excitement, packed shoulder-to-shoulder but moving in perfect rhythm. Thousands of fans are waving glowing halo-lightsticks, creating a twinkling ocean of lights that stretches as far as the eye can see. Confetti drifts through the spotlights like glittering snow. The bass thumps in Bubblegum’s chest, joyful and heavy. It is loud, it is colorful, and it is absolutely magical. The ultimate celebration of music that she, a Hunter-Idol, is sworn to protect!

## The Backstage Gate

Talin, her manager, hurried over to the gelato stall where Bubblegum stood. He adjusted his headset then frantically tapped on his tablet. Even in his panic, Talin looked sharp, wearing a fitted blazer over a bright graphic tee, but the usual confident smile was gone from his face. His expression was deadly serious.

"Bubblegum!" Talin gasped. "I’ve got a bad feeling. The spiritual sensors on my tablet are going haywire!"

He glanced around nervously, lowering his voice so the crowd wouldn't hear. "The energy backstage feels... off. It’s clashing, like a song played in the wrong key."

He looked Bubblegum right in the eyes. "I need you to sneak back there and find out what’s causing the dissonance. Don't worry about the stage crew; I'll handle the fans out front!"

Talin gave her a firm nod. "Go save the show!"

## The Grumpy Guardian

Bubblegum dashed toward the backstage gate marked with a flashing "ARTISTS ONLY" sign, her shiny boots squeaking on the pavement. But before she could slip through, she froze.

A mountain of a man was blocking her path. He sat in a small shaking stool planted directly in front of the door, his broad shoulders practically taking up the whole gate. He looked very grumpy, scowling as if he had just bitten into a sour lemon.

Bubblegum spotted a lanyard hanging around his thick neck. It featured the sharp, jagged, dark logo of Vanta-Black, the rival band famous for their super-edgy, "no-smiling allowed" music videos. No wonder he looked so serious!

The guard looked up and crossed his massive arms. "Hold it," he grumbled, his voice deep and gravelly. "No pass, no entry. And you are not on my list."

:::

Bubblegum didn't back down. She stepped right up to the huge security guard. He tightened his crossed arms, looking ready to growl at her to go away. But Bubblegum was clever! She had spotted the lanyard around his neck, and she knew exactly what to do.

She flashed him her brightest, most confident idol smile. "Excuse me! I just had to stop. Is that a Vanta-Black lanyard?" She leaned in, her voice full of excitement. "Their comeback stage last week was incredible! The way 'Shadow' hit that triple high note while doing the backflip? Totally legendary behavior."

The guard’s jaw actually dropped a little bit. He looked down at his lanyard, then back at Bubblegum, totally surprised. The grumpy scowl melted away like ice cream in the sun, replaced by a look of grudging respect.

"Whoa. You... you actually know good music," he grumbled, but his voice was much less scary now. He even cracked a tiny, almost-invisible smile. "Yeah, Shadow is the real deal. Most kids these days just like the fluffy stuff. You got good taste, kid."

He didn't just let her in. He moved the fence to leave a large opening and stepped aside with a clumsy little bow. Then, to make sure she had a clear path, he effortlessly kicked a heavy equipment box out of her way.

"Go on ahead," he said, giving her a big thumbs-up. "Knock 'em dead out there. And hey, if you see Vanta-Black back there, tell 'em 'Stan' said hi."

## The Dressing Room Disaster

Bubblegum slipped past the security guard and stepped into the "backstage" village, a maze of temporary tents set up right on the grass beside the towering main stage. The canvas walls flapped in the evening breeze, but the mood inside was far from breezy.

It was a total disaster zone! Usually, this area was full of laughter and warm-ups, but tonight, makeup kits were knocked over, spilling pink and gold glitter into the dirt. Costumes were ripped, and sequins crunched underfoot on the temporary flooring.

Even the super-cool members of Vanta-Black weren't safe. Under the largest tent, the edgy band members were yelling at each other over a broken hair dryer. The whole place felt awful—thick with sticky stage fright and bad moods.

The idols aren't the real problem, Bubblegum realized, sensing the strange magic in the air. This is an attack. She scanned the chaotic campsite, looking past the angry idols to find the true source of the trouble. There! Hiding inside an open cardboard box filled with neon-pink glow-sticks was a small, fuzzy creature.

It looked like a ball of living TV static with mean, glowing little eyes. It was a Static-ling, a nasty little Dissonance Demon! The creature was buzzing quietly, whispering bad, nervous thoughts to the idols, feeding the chaos and making everyone fight.

:::

Bubblegum knew she couldn't fight this with fists. She needed to fight it with a feeling.

She planted her feet firmly on the plastic flooring, took a deep breath, and let her melody loose. She didn't shout, she didn't need to, she simply began to sing. As her voice, sweet and clear as a bell, washed over the backstage area, the chaotic energy simply evaporated. The members of Vanta-Black froze, their shouting dying in their throats mid-syllable. The leader of the band lowered the broken hair dryer, looking down at it with sudden confusion. The other dancers stopped their bickering, their hands halted in mid-gesture. Even the spilled glitter seemed to sparkle with a little less aggression.

The silence that followed wasn't empty; it was peaceful. The idols looked around, cheeks flushing pink as they realized how loudly they had been screaming over nothing.

But for one creature, the song was agony. The beautiful harmony didn't just calm the idols; it acted like a spotlight, burning away the shadowy cover the demon had been using. As the ambient dissonance quieted, the Static-ling was left exposed. Inside the box of glow sticks, the ball of dark static twisted violently. It let out a high-pitched squeak, like a radio being tuned rapidly past a dead channel. It couldn't stand the purity of the sound.

Before Bubblegum could move to capture it, the Static-ling panicked. It rocketed out of the box, sending a spray of neon glow sticks clattering across the floor. It zipped past Bubblegum’s legs with startling speed, a blur of fuzzy grey darkness.

"Hey!" Bubblegum shouted, breaking her song.

But the creature was already moving. It streaked across the floorboards, chattering angrily, and darted toward the exit of the tent village. Bubblegum gasped as she realized its trajectory. It wasn't retreating into the dark; it was heading for the loudest, most chaotic place it could find. It was heading straight for the main stage.

## The Big Stage Setback

Bubblegum didn't hesitate. The split second the fuzzy ball of static zipped past her boots, she spun on her heel and sprinted after it.

She burst from the relative quiet of the tent village directly into the sonic wall of the Side Stage. The noise was absolute, a physical force that thrummed against her ribs. The popular girl group "Twinkle Stars" was mid-chorus of their biggest hit, the music booming out over a screaming sea of thousands. Dazzling stage lights swept across the wings, the sudden flash blinding Bubblegum for a heartbeat.

The wings were a treacherous obstacle course. Roadies clad in black t-shirts shoved heavy flight cases through narrow gaps, while thick black power cables snaked across the floor like synthetic vines, waiting to trip the unwary. Crew members shouted frantically into headsets, their voices lost in the roar of the performance.

Bubblegum spotted her target. The little grey Static-ling was moving impossibly fast, a nasty blur of negative energy weaving between the legs of a startled cameraman. It was aiming for the towering speaker stack beside the main screen.

Bubblegum knew exactly what was about to happen. If that creature made contact with the sound system, the beautiful music would be shredded by painful feedback and electronic screeching. The crowd would boo, the idols would be heartbroken, and the demon would gorge itself on the sudden banquet of misery. She had to stop it.

:::

Bubblegum’s boots ignited with swirling white magic, and she zoomed forward like a rocket. She was moving faster than she ever had in her life, a blur of motion cutting through the backstage clutter. Roadies gasped and dropped their cables as a streak of blue, purple, and white light whipped past them. The little grey Static-ling was fast, but Bubblegum was faster.

Just as the demon leaped through the air, aiming its fuzzy body directly at the giant speaker tower, Bubblegum made her move. She dropped into a perfect power-slide, the magic in her boots acting like a cushion of compressed air. She slid right in front of the tower, blocking the path at the last possible second.

THWACK!

The Static-ling slammed squarely into the side of her magical boot instead of the speaker. It let out a surprised squeak and ricocheted backward, tumbling across the stage floor like a discarded lint ball.

Above them, the music of Twinkle Stars continued without a hitch. The crowd roared their approval, completely oblivious to the fact that Bubblegum had just saved the entire concert from sonic disaster.

But the demon wasn't finished yet. It rolled to a stop in the center of the wings, hemmed in by heavy equipment cases. It shook itself off, its little red eyes glowing with furious, bright intensity. It knew it couldn't hide anymore. It was trapped, angry, and hungry for a fight.

Suddenly, the little fuzzball began to twitch and expand. It pulled the front speakers nearby and loose wires toward itself, absorbing them into its mass, growing bigger, darker, and uglier by the second.

## The Feedback Fiend!

The Static-ling grows bigger and bigger. It merges with the equipment and speakers, forming a giant monster made of tangled wires, static, and shadows. The "Feedback Fiend" roars, and it's a sound like a microphone screeching!

![The Feedback Fiend](/images/demon-hunter/01_06_The_Feedback_Fiend.png)

:::rolls
This is a "social combat." We'll take turns.

Instead of "Health," the Demon has "Vibe Points." This is a measure of its shield of nasty static energy. Demon's Vibe Points: 5. Demon’s Dissonance Armor: 2

The battle happens in rounds. In each round, Bubblegum gets to act, and then the Demon gets to act.

- Turn 1: Bubblegum's Attack (The Melody)
  Bubblegum sings her heart out and dances up a storm to damage the demon's negative energy field.
(Rule Idea: Roll Presence + Expression - Dissonance. Success 7+)

- Turn 2: The Demon's Counter-Attack (The Feedback)
  Now the Demon tries to stop her. It doesn't punch her; it attacks her confidence. It unleaches a horrible screeching noise and waves of paralyzing doubt and fear.
(Rule Idea: Roll 5 Dice - Composure. Success 7+)

Each success of the Demon attack reduces the player’s Presence for the next turn

> Bubblegum Attack. Roll Presence 4 + Expression 5 + specialty Singing 1 - Dissonance 2. Success 7+ -> 8d10 -> 4 success

> Demon Attack. Roll 5 - Composure 2 -> 3d10 -> 3 success

> Bubblegum Attack. Roll Presence 4 - Doubt 3 + Expression 5 + specialty Singing 1 - Dissonance 2. Success 7+ -> 5d10 -> 3 success
:::

The Twinkle Stars stopped singing abruptly mid-verse. They quickly dropped their microphones and hurried off the main stage toward safety. This was Bubblegum’s moment, the real fight was about to begin.

Bubblegum seized the rhythm still thumping through the giant speakers. Spinning on her heel to face the towering beast, she raised her microphone and hijacked the Twinkle Stars' instrumental track. She belted out new lyrics over their beat, transforming the pop hit into her own personal power anthem. Her voice was perfection. The music became waves of pure, sparkling, pink energy that shaved the demon's static armor, turning it into harmless, glittering confetti.

The monster shrieked in fury at being damaged by the melody. It retaliated, not with claws, but with noise. It screamed a horrible "Stage Fright" back to Bubblegum. The dazzling backstage lights seemed to dim, casting long, scary shadows across the floor. A crushing weight settled on Bubblegum’s chest, choking her next breath. Her confident smile faltered. The doubt whispered loudly in her ear: You're going to mess up. Everyone else ran away. You aren't good enough to stop this alone. Her knees shook, and her sparkling presence dimmed significantly as the negativity seeped into her.

But a true Hunter-Idol never stops the show! Even with her confidence shaken and her throat feeling tight with fear, Bubblegum pushed through. She relied on her endless hours of rigorous training. She forced her body to keep dancing to the beat, letting muscle memory take over where her courage flagged. She sang the bridge of the song, her voice wavering slightly but hitting every note with determined accuracy. The melody, though quieter now and less flashy, still held true power. It struck the Feedback Fiend again, the giant monster was looking weak, its dissonance aura vanished. It was time to finish it.

## Encore!

Bubblegum hit the final, amazing high note of her performance. A palpable wave of pure-hearted energy erupted from her microphone, slamming squarely into the Feedback Fiend. It explodes into a cloud of harmless, sparkling confetti. The crowd, thinking it was all an incredible special effect, goes absolutely WILD. They are chanting her name over and over "BUB-BLE-GUM! BUB-BLE-GUM!"

She stood center stage, catching her breath, bathed in the bright lights and surrounded by swirling glitter dust. A massive surge of pride swelled within her chest. She had actually done it; her first mission was a complete success. With a beaming, triumphant smile, she bent deep in a theatrical bow to her adoring new fans.

As she straightened up, she glanced toward the backstage wing of the stage. The rival idol group, Vanta-Black, stood there, staring open-mouthed at the spectacle she had created. Their stern leader caught Bubblegum's eye and offered a respectful nod. It was clear they wouldn't be messing with her again.

As the glitter settles on the stage floor, something catches Bubblegum's attention. It is the only thing on the floor that isn't glittering.

Lying right where the creature of gloom had burst apart was a small rectangular object. Bending down, the hero picked it up. It felt strangely heavy and icy cold against their skin, more like a slab of carved obsidian stone than simple paper. It was slick to the touch and looked very expensive. There was no name, no phone number, and no email address. In the center, embossed in shining, chilly silver, was just one symbol:

Ω

Below the Omega symbol, in very fine silver letters, it read: APEX MANAGEMENT GROUP – Talent Acquisition & Obfuscation Division.

A sudden shiver ran through Bubblegum just holding it, even under the heat of the stage spotlights. The card felt hollow. It felt like the exact opposite of music. Bubblegum tucked the strange black card into a pocket before the stage managers came out. Whatever just attacked the concert, it wasn't working alone. It has a manager.
