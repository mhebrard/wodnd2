# Seoul-Pop-Palooza

The sun has just dipped below the horizon, turning the sky into a deep, electric twilight blue. It’s the perfect time for the "Seoul-Pop-Palooza" to shine! The massive main stage is a towering masterpiece of steel trusses and dazzling lights, blasting beams of pink, teal, and lime green high into the air.

Huge LED screens span the width of the stage, pulsing with colorful abstract graphics that move to the beat of the music. The energy here is electric! Down in the front, the food vendors aren't just trucks, they are sleek, retro-futuristic vehicles outlined in glowing neon tubes, serving up treats under bright signs that say "FOOD TRUCKS" and "VENDOR".

The crowd is a sea of excitement, packed shoulder-to-shoulder but moving in perfect rhythm. Thousands of fans are waving glowing halo-lightsticks, creating a twinkling ocean of lights that stretches as far as the eye can see. Confetti drifts through the spotlights like glittering snow. The bass thumps in Bubblegum’s chest, joyful and heavy. It is loud, it is colorful, and it is absolutely magical. The ultimate celebration of music that she, a Hunter-Idol, is sworn to protect!

## The Backstage Gate

Talin, her manager, hurried over to the gelato stall where Bubblegum stood. He adjusted his headset then frantically tapped his clipboard. Even in his panic, Talin looked sharp, wearing a fitted blazer over a bright graphic tee, but the usual confident smile was gone from his face. His expression was deadly serious.

"Bubblegum!" Talin gasped. "I’ve got a bad feeling. The spiritual sensors on my tablet are going haywire!"

He glanced around nervously, lowering his voice so the stage crew wouldn't hear. "The energy backstage feels... off. It’s clashing, like a song played in the wrong key."

He looked Bubblegum right in the eyes. "I need you to sneak back there and find out what’s causing the dissonance before the big finale. Don't worry about the stage crew; I'll handle the fans out front!"

Talin gave her a firm nod. "Go save the show!"

## The Grumpy Guardian

Bubblegum dashed toward the backstage gate marked with a flashing "ARTISTS ONLY" sign, her shiney boots squeaking on the pavement. But before she could slip through, she skidded to a halt.

A mountain of a man was blocking her path. He sat in a small shaking stool planted directly in front of the door, his broad shoulders practically taking up the whole gate. He looked very grumpy, scowling as if he had just bitten into a sour lemon.

Bubblegum spotted a lanyard hanging around his thick neck. It featured the sharp, jagged, dark logo of Vanta-Black, the rival band famous for their super-edgy, "no-smiling allowed" music videos. No wonder he looked so serious!

The guard looked up and crossed his massive arms. "Hold it," he grumbled, his voice deep and gravelly. "No pass, no entry. And you are not on my list."

Bubblegum didn't back down. She stepped right up to the huge security guard. He tightened his crossed arms, looking ready to growl at her to go away. But Bubblegum was clever! She had spotted the lanyard around his neck, and she knew exactly what to do.

She flashed him her brightest, most confident idol smile. "Excuse me! I just had to stop. Is that a Vanta-Black lanyard?" She leaned in, her voice full of excitement. "Their comeback stage last week was incredible! The way 'Shadow' hit that triple high note while doing the backflip? Totally legendary behavior."

The guard’s jaw actually dropped a little bit. He looked down at his lanyard, then back at Bubblegum, totally surprised. The grumpy scowl melted away like ice cream in the sun, replaced by a look of grudging respect.

"Whoa. You... you actually know good music," he grumbled, but his voice was much less scary now. He even cracked a tiny, almost-invisible smile. "Yeah, Shadow is the real deal. Most kids these days just like the fluffy stuff. You got good taste, kid."

He didn't just let her in. He moved the fence to leave a large opening and stepped aside with a clumsy little bow. Then, to make sure she had a clear path, he effortlessly kicked a heavy equipment box out of her way.

"Go on ahead," he said, giving her a big thumbs-up. "Knock 'em dead out there. And hey, if you see Vanta-Black back there, tell 'em 'Stan' said hi."

## The Dressing Room Disaster

Bubblegum slipped past the security guard and stepped into the "backstage" village, a maze of temporary tents set up right on the grass beside the towering main stage. The canvas walls flapped in the evening breeze, but the mood inside was far from breezy.

It was a total disaster zone! Usually, this area was full of laughter and warm-ups, but tonight, makeup kits were knocked over, spilling pink and gold glitter into the dirt. Costumes were ripped, and sequins crunched underfoot on the temporary flooring.

Even the super-cool members of Vanta-Black weren't safe. Under the largest tent, the edgy band members were yelling at each other over a broken hair dryer. The whole place felt awful—thick with sticky stage fright and bad moods.

The idols aren't the real problem, Bubblegum realized, sensing the strange magic in the air. This is an attack. She scanned the chaotic campsite, looking past the angry idols to find the true source of the trouble. There! Hiding inside an open cardboard box filled with neon-pink glow-sticks was a small, fuzzy creature.

It looked like a ball of living TV static with mean, glowing little eyes. It was a Static-ling, a nasty little Dissonance Demon! The creature was buzzing quietly, whispering bad, nervous thoughts to the idols, feeding the chaos and making everyone fight.
