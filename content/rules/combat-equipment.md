# Combat & Equipment

## Initiative, Combat and Damages

Prior to a combat, each character who is not surprised, rolls a dice and adds his Initiative trait to the result. Who gets the highest score, acts first during the combat. A Combat is a succession of Instant Actions. Each Attack is represented by a roll, Attribute + Skill + Weapon - Defense - Armor. Each success represents one point of damage inflicted to the target and deduced to his Health trait. When the target has no Health left, he is unconscious or dead (depending on the type of damage done). There are three types of damage:

- **Bashing (B)**: caused by fist and feet that heal 1 point per 15min
- **Lethal (L)**: caused by weapons that heal 1 point by 2 days
- **Aggravated (A)**: caused by supernatural attacks that heal 1 point by week

## Equipment

An object has a Size and a Durability that reflect the hardness of the object. An Attack’s Damage must exceed Durability before the object is harmed. It has also a Structure that reflects how many damages they can endure before break (Structure = Durability + Size). An object does not heal from damages over time, it must be repaired.

Weapons deal lethal damages. Damages (Dmg) indicate the number of dice the weapon adds to the attack roll. Size indicates if the weapon can be hidden in a hand (1), a coat (2) or cannot be hidden (3+). It also indicates the minimal strength needed to use the weapon without a malus of -1 dice. Special indicates a feature of the weapon or the short / medium / long range. At medium and long range suffer a -2 and -4 dice respectively.
