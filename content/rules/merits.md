- **Encyclopedic Knowledge** (2 or 4)
Effect: Your character has collected limitless factoids. For 2 dots, choose a Skill, for 4 dots, work on any topics. You can make an Intelligence + Wits roll at any time. On a successful, your character remembers a relevant fact on the topic.
- **Eye for the Strange** (2)
Prerequisite: Resolve 2, Occult 1
Effect: Your character can determine whether something comes from natural or supernatural origin. Roll Intelligence + Composure. With a success, you find an evidence that confirm the nature of the event. With an exceptional success, you remember a bit of supernatural folklore or a +2 to all rolls to investigate.

Effect: When taking an extended action, halve the time required between rolls.
- **Holistic Awareness** (1)
Effect: Your character is skilled at non-traditional healing methods. She can provide basic medical care with natural means. Unless your patient suffers from aggravated wounds, you do not need medical equipment to treat injuries. With a source of diverse flora, a Wits + Survival roll allows your character to gather all necessary supplies. Intelligence + Medicine roll once a day halves the healing time of your patient.
- **Indomitable** (2)
Prerequisite: Resolve 3

- **Patient** (1)
Effect: Your character knows how to pace herself and take the time to do the job right the first time. When taking an extended action, get +1 per roll.
- **Tolerance for Biology** (1)
Prerequisite: Resolve 3
Effect: Most people turn away at the sight of blood, other bodily fluids, or exotic biology. Your character has seen enough that nothing turns her stomach. You do not need to make Composure, Stamina, or Resolve rolls to withstand the biologically strange. This doesn’t mean she’s immune to fear; she’s just used to nature in all its nasty forms.
- **Trained Observer** (1 or 3)
Prerequisite: Wits 3 or Composure 3
Effect: Your character has spent years in the field, catching tiny details and digging for secrets. Any time you make a Perception roll (Wits + Composure), you benefit from the 9-again quality. With the 3-dot version, you get 8-again.
- **Unseen Sense** (3)
Prerequisite: Wits 2
Effect: Your character has a “sixth sense” when it comes to the supernatural. His body reacts to the presence of unseen forces. The nature of the reaction and the phenomenon that trigger it can vary according to the wishes of the player and under the Storyteller agreement.

## Physical Merits
- **Ambidextrous** (3)
Effect: Your character does not suffer the -2 penalty for using his off-hand in combat or to perform other actions.
- **Brawling Dodge** (1)
Prerequisite: Strength 2 and Brawl 1
Effect: Whenever your character performs a Dodge, you can choose to add his Brawl Skill to his Defense instead of doubling his Defense. Your character can move up to his Speed and perform a Brawling Dodge maneuver in a turn. A character can possess both the Brawling Dodge and Weaponry Dodge Merits, but only one can be used per turn.
- **Crack Driver** (2 or 3)
Prerequisite: Drive 3
Effect: Your character is a gifted driver. So long as she’s not taking any actions other than driving, add her Composure to any rolls to drive.

- **Demolisher** (1 to 3)
Prerequisite: Strength 3 or Intelligence 3
Effect: Your character has an innate feel for the weak points in objects. When damaging an object, she ignores one point of the object’s Durability per dot in this Merit.
- **Disarm** (2)
Prerequisite: Dexterity 3 and Weaponry 2
Effect: Your character can use a weapon to disarm opponents. When making an attack, if you get a number of successes equal to or greater than the opponent’s Dexterity, you can choose to have your character disarm him instead of doing damage. A weapon lands a number of yards away from the opponent equal to your successes rolled.
- **Double Jointed** (2)
Prerequisite: Dexterity 3
Effect: Your character can dislodge joints when need be. She automatically escapes from any mundane bonds. When grappled, subtract her Dexterity from any rolls to overpower her as long as she’s not taking any aggressive actions.
- **Fleet of Foot** (1 to 3)
Prerequisite: Athletics 2
Effect: Your character gains +1 Speed per dot; anyone pursuing her suffers a –1 per dot to any foot chase rolls.
- **Giant** (3)
Effect: Your character is massive. She’s Size 7. Available only at creation.
- **Hardy** (1 to 3)
Prerequisite: Stamina 3

Prerequisites: Stamina 3 or Resolve 3
Effect: Each dot eliminates a negative modifier when resisting the effects of fatigue or injury (wound penalties).
- **Iron Stomach** (2)
Prerequisites: Stamina 2
Effect: Your character can eat almost anything, under almost any conditions.  Add two dice to appropriate Survival rolls. Add three to Stamina to resist deprivation.
- **Natural Immunity** (1)
Prerequisites: Stamina 2
Effect: Your character gains a +2 modifier on Stamina rolls to resist infection, sickness and disease.
- **Parkour** (1 to 5)
Prerequisites: Dexterity 3, Athletics 2
Effect: Your character is a trained and proficient free-runner. It is the art of moving fluidly through environments with complex leaps, bounds, running tricks, vaulting, and climbing.
  - Flow (1): Your character reacts instinctively to any obstacles with leaps, jumps, and scaling techniques. When in a foot chase, subtract your Parkour from the successes needed to pursue or evade. Ignore environmental penalties to Athletics rolls equal to your Parkour rating.
  - Cat Leap (2): Your character falls with outstanding grace. When using a Dexterity + Athletics roll to mitigate damage from falling, your character gains one automatic success. Additionally, add your Parkour rating to the threshold of damage that can be removed through this roll. Parkour will not mitigate damage from a terminal velocity fall.
  - Wall Run (3): When climbing, your character can run upward for some distance before having to traditionally climb. Your character scaled 10 feet + 5 feet per dot of Athletics as an instant action, rather than the normal 10 feet.
  - Expert Traceur (4): Parkour has become second nature for your character. By spending a Willpower point, you may designate one Athletics roll to run, jump, or climb as a rote action (reroll all failed dice once). On any turn you use this ability, you may not apply your character’s Defense to oncoming attacks.
  - Freeflow (5): Your character’s Parkour is now muscle memory. She can move without thinking in a zen-like state. Your character is capable of taking Athletics actions reflexively once per turn. By spending a point of Willpower on an Athletics roll in a foot chase, gain three successes instead of three dice.
- **Quick Draw** (1)
Prerequisites: Wits 3 or Dexterity 3, a Specialty in Weaponry or Shoot
Effect: Choose a Specialty in Weaponry or Shoot. Drawing or holstering that weapon is considered a reflexive action, and can be done any time her Defense applies.

Effect: Your character recovers from injuries in half the time that others do. 
- **Sleight of Hand** (2)

- **Strong Back** (1)
Prerequisites: Strength 2
Effect: Your character gains a +1 modifier to actions involving lifting or carrying heavy weights.
- **Strong Lungs** (3)
Prerequisite: Athletics 3
Effect: Your character is practiced at holding his breath for long periods of time. Consider Stamina+2 to calculate how long he can stay without breathing.
- **Stunt Driver** (3)
Prerequisites: Dexterity 3
Effect: Your character can drive a vehicle and perform an unrelated action in the same turn.
- **Toxin Resistance** (2)
Prerequisite: Stamina 3
Effect: Your character gains a +2 modifier to Stamina rolls to resist the effects of drugs, poisons and toxins.
- **Weaponry Dodge** (1)
Prerequisite: Strength 2 and Brawl 1
Effect: Whenever your character performs a Dodge, you can choose to add his Weaponry Skill to his Defense instead of doubling his Defense. Your character can move up to his Speed and perform a Weaponry Dodge maneuver in a turn. A character can possess both the Brawling Dodge and Weaponry Dodge Merits, but only one can be used per turn

## Social Merits

- **Allies** (1 to 5)
Effect: Allies help your character. Each instance of this Merit represents one type of ally. This could be in an organization, a society, a clique, or an individual. Each purchase has its own rating. Each dot represents a layer of influence in the group. One dot would constitute small favors and passing influence. Three could offer considerable influence, such as the overlooking of a misdemeanor charge by the police. Five dots stretch the limits of the organization’s influence, as its leaders put their own influence on the line for the character. This could include things such as massive insider training or fouling up a felony investigation. No matter the request, it has to be something that organization could accomplish. A character can ask for favors that add up to her Allies rating without penalty in one chapter. If she extends her influence beyond that, her player must roll Manipulation + Persuasion + Allies, with a penalty equal to the favor’s rating. If the roll is successful, the group does as requested. Failed or successful, the character loses a dot of Allies. This dot may return at the end of the chapter. On a dramatic failure, the organization resents her and seeks retribution. On an exceptional success, she doesn’t lose the dot.
- **Alternate Identity** (1 to 3)
Effect: Your character has established an alternate identity. The level of this Merit determines the amount of scrutiny it can withstand. At one dot, the identity is superficial and unofficial. For example, your character uses an alias with a simple costume and adopts an accent. She hasn’t established the necessary paperwork to even approach a bureaucratic background check, let alone pass. At two dots, she’s supported her identity with paperwork and identification. It’s not liable to stand up to extensive research, but it’ll turn away private investigators and internet hobbyists. At three dots, the identity can pass thorough inspection. The identity has been deeply entrenched in relevant databases, with subtle flourishes and details to make it seem real even to trained professionals. The Merit also reflects time the character has spent honing the persona. At one or two dots, she gains a +1 to all Subterfuge rolls to defend the identity. At three dots, she gains +2.
- **Anonymity** (1 to 5)
Prerequisites: Cannot have Fame and limited Status.
Effect: Your character lives off the grid. She eschews identification. She avoids any official authoritative influence in her affairs. Any attempts to find her by paper trail suffer a -1 penalty per dot purchased in this Merit.
- **Barfly** (2)
Prerequisite: Socialize 2
Effect: Your character is a natural in the bar environment and can procure an open invitation wherever she wishes. Whereas most characters would require rolls to blend into social functions they don’t belong in, she doesn’t; she    belongs. Rolls to identify her as an outsider suffer her Socialize as a penalty.
- **Contacts** (1 to 5)
Effect: Contacts provide your character with information. Each dot in this Merit represents a sphere or organization with which the character can garner information. Contacts do not provide services, only information. This may be face-to-face, mail, or even by séance in some strange instances. Garnering information via Contacts requires a Manipulation + Social Skill roll, depending on the method the character uses. If successful, the Contact provides the information.
- **Fame** (1 to 3)
Effect: Your character is recognized within a certain sphere. This can mean favors and attention, but it can also mean negative attention and scrutiny. When choosing the Merit, define what your character is known for. As a rule of thumb, one dot means local recognition or reputation within a confined subculture. Two dots means regional recognition by a wide swath of people. Three dots means worldwide recognition to anyone who might have been exposed to the source of the fame. Each dot adds a die to any Social rolls among those who are impressed by your character’s celebrity.
- **Familiar** (1 to 4 dots): 
  - 1 dot: a small animal follows you but do not fight
  - 2 dots: an medium animal will fight for you but fleet if wounded
  - 3 dots: a medium animal will fight to death for you
  - 3 dots: a small supernatural animal follows you but do not fight
  - 4 dots: a medium supernatural animal will fight for you but fleet if wounded
Attributes: 1 all + Small 3/3/2, Medium 5/4/3 (Power, Finesse, Resistance) 
Skills: Small 0, Medium 9/6/3
Willpower: Equal to Resolve + Composure
Initiative: Equal to Dexterity + Composure
Defense: Equal to lowest of Dexterity and Wits
Speed: Strength + Dexterity + Size
Health: Equal to Stamina + Size
Mastery: Supernatural 1
Paths: Supernatural 2 dots
- **Fast-Talking** (1 to 5)
Prerequisites: Manipulation 3, Subterfuge 2
Effect: Your character talks circles around listeners. She speaks a mile a minute and often leaves her targets reeling, but nodding in agreement.
  - Always Be Closing (1): With the right leading phrases, your character can direct a mark to say what she wants, when she wants. This trips the mark into vulnerable positions. When a mark contests or resists your character’s Social interactions, apply a -1 to their Resolve or Composure.
  - Jargon (2): Your character confuses her mark using complex terminology. You may apply one relevant Specialty to any Social roll you make, even if the Specialty isn’t tied to the Skill in use.
  - Devil’s Advocacy (3): Your character often poses arguments she doesn’t agree with in order to challenge a mark’s position and keep him from advancing discussion. You can reroll one failed Subterfuge roll per scene.
  - Salting (4): Your character can position herself so a mark pursues a non-issue or something unimportant to her. When your character opens a Door using conversation (Persuasion, Subterfuge, Empathy...) you may spend a Willpower point to immediately open another Door.
  - The Nigerian Scam (5): Your character can take advantage of her mark’s greed and zeal. When the mark does particularly well, it’s because your character was there to set him up and to subsequently tear him down. You may immediately roll Manipulation + Subterfuge to open a Door, regardless of the interval or impression level.
- **Fixer** (2)
Prerequisite: Contacts 2, Wits 3
Effect: Your character is somebody that knows people. She can not only get in touch with the right people to do a job, but she can get them at the best possible prices.
- **Hobbyist Clique** (2)
Prerequisite: Membership in a clique. All members must possess this Merit and the chosen Skill at 2+
Effect: Your character is part of a group of hobbyists that specialize in one area, as represented by a Skill. It may be a book club, a coven, a political party, or any other interest. When the group’s support is available, you benefit from the 9-again quality on rolls involving the group’s chosen Skill. As well, the clique offers two additional dice on any extended actions involving that Skill.
- **Inspiring** (3)
Prerequisite: Presence 3
Effect: Your character’s passion inspires those around her to greatness. With a few words, she can redouble a group’s confidence or move them to action.
Make a Presence + Expression roll. A small clique of listeners levies a -1 penalty, a small crowd a -2, and a large crowd a -3. Listeners gain the Inspired condition.
- **Iron Will** (2)
Prerequisite: Resolve 4
Effect: Your character’s resolve is unwavering. When spending Willpower to contest or resist in a Social interaction, you may substitute your character’s Resolve for the usual Willpower bonus. If the roll is contested, roll with 8-again.
- **Mentor** (1 to 5)
Effect: This Merit gives your character a teacher that provides advice and guidance. He acts on your character’s behalf, often in the background and sometimes without your character’s knowledge. While Mentors can be highly competent, they almost always want something in return for their services. The dot rating determines the Mentor’s capabilities, and to what extent he’ll aid your character. When establishing a Mentor, determine what the Mentor wants from your character. This should be personally important to him and it should reflect on the dot rating chosen. A one-dot Mentor might be incapable of dealing with modern society and want to live vicariously through your character. This might mean coming to him and telling stories of her exploits. A five-dot Mentor would want something astronomical, such as an oath to procure an ancient, cursed artifact that may or may not exist, in order to prevent a prophesized death. Choose three Skills the Mentor possesses. You can substitute Resources for one of these Skills. Once per session, the character may ask her Mentor for a favor. The favor must involve one of those Skills or be within the scope of his Resources. The Mentor commits to the favor (often asking for a commensurate favor in return); and if a roll is required, the Mentor is automatically considered to have successes equal to his dot rating.
- **Resources** (1 to 5)
Effect: This Merit reflects your character’s disposable income. The dot rating determines the relative amount of disposable funding the character has available, depending on your particular chronicle’s setting. One dot is a little spending money here and there. Two is a comfortable, middle class wage. Three is a nicer, upper middle-class life. Four is moderately wealthy. Five is filthy rich. 
- **Retainer** (1 to 5)
Effect: Your character has an assistant, sycophant, servant, or follower on whom she can rely. Establish who this companion is and how he was acquired. It may be as simple as a paycheck. He might owe your character his life. However it happened, your character has a hold on him. A Retainer is more reliable than a Mentor and more loyal than an Ally. On the other hand, a Retainer is a lone person, less capable and influential than the broader Merits. The Merit’s dot rating determines the relative competency of the Retainer. A one-dot Retainer is barely able to do anything of use, such as a pet that knows one useful trick or a homeless old man that does minor errands for food. A three-dot Retainer is a professional in their field, someone capable in his line of work. A five-dot is one of the best in her class. If a Retainer needs to make a roll, if it’s within her field, double the dot rating and use it as a dice pool. For anything else, use the dot rating as a dice pool.
- **Safe Place** (1 to 5)
Effect: Your character has somewhere she can go where she can feel secure. While she may have enemies that could attack her there, she’s prepared and has the upper hand. The dot rating reflects the security of the place. The actual location, the luxury, and the size are represented by equipment. A one-dot Safe Place might be equipped with basic security systems or a booby trap at the windows and door. A five-dot could have a security crew, or trained dogs. Each place could be an apartment, a mansion or a hidey-hole. Unlike most Merits, multiple characters can contribute dots to a single Safe Place, combining their points into something greater. A Safe Place gives an Initiative bonus equal to the Merit dots. This only applies to a character with dots invested in the Safe Place. Any efforts to breach the Safe Place suffer a penalty equal to the Merit dots invested. If the character desires, the Safe Place can include traps that cause intruders lethal damage equal to a maximum of the Merit. This requires that the character has at least a dot in Crafts. The traps may be avoided with a Dexterity + Larceny roll, penalized by the Safe Place dots.
- **Small Unit Tactics** (2)
Prerequisites: Presence 3
Effect: Your character is a proficient leader on the field. She can organize efforts and bark orders to remarkable effect. Once per scene, when making a coordinated action that was planned in advance, spend a point of Willpower and an instant action. A number of characters equal to your character’s Presence can benefit from the +3 bonus from the Willpower expenditure.
- **Staff** (1 to 5)
Effect: Your character has a crew of workers or assistants at her disposal. They may be housekeepers, designers, research assistants, animators, cheap thugs, or whatever else makes sense. For every dot in this Merit, choose one type of assistant, and one Skill. At any reasonable time, her staff can take actions using that Skill. These actions automatically garner a single success. While not useful in contested actions, this guarantees success on minor, mundane activities. Note that you may have employees without requiring the Staff Merit. Staff simply adds a mechanical advantage for those groups.
- **Status** (1 to 5)
Effect: Your character has standing, membership, authority, control over, or respect from a group or organization. This may reflect official standing or informal respect. No matter the source, your character enjoys certain privileges within that structure. Each instance of this Merit reflects standing in a different group or organization. Each affords its own unique benefits. As you increase dot ratings, your character rises in prominence in the relevant group. Status only allows advantages within the confines of the group reflected in the Merit. Status provides a number of advantages. First, your character can apply her Status to any Social roll with those over which she has authority or sway. Second, she has access to group facilities, resources, and funding. Dependent on the group, this could be limited by red tape and requisitioning processes. It’s also dependent on the resources the particular group has available.
- **Striking Looks** (1 or 2)
Effect: Your character is stunning, alarming, commanding, repulsing, threatening, charming, or otherwise worthy of attention. Determine how your character looks and how people react to that. Your character gets a bonus equal to the Merit dots on any Social rolls that would be influenced by her looks.
- **Sympathetic** (2)
Effect: Your character is very good at letting others get close. This gives him an edge in getting what he wants. At the beginning of a Social maneuvering attempt, you may choose to accept a Condition such as Leveraged, Swooning or Vulnerable in order to immediately eliminate two of the subject’s Doors.
- **Taste** (1)
Effect: Your character has refined tastes and can identify minor details in fashion, food, architecture, and other forms of artistry and craftsmanship. Not only does this give an eye for detail, it makes her a center of attention in critical circles. She can appraise items within her area of expertise. With a Wits + Skill roll, depending on the creation in question, your character can pick out obscure details about the item that other, less discerning minds would not.
- **True Friend** (3)
Effect: Your character has a true friend. While that friend may have specific functions covered by other Merits (Allies, Contacts, Retainer, Mentor…), True Friend represents a deeper, truly trusting relationship that cannot be breached. Unless your character does something egregious to cause it, her True Friend will not betray her. Any rolls to influence a True Friend against your character suffer a five-die penalty. In addition, once per story your character can regain one spent Willpower by having a meaningful interaction with her True Friend.

## Fighting Merits

- **Armed Defense** (1 to 5)
Prerequisites: Dexterity 3, Weaponry 2, Defensive Combat: Weaponry
Effect: You’re able to use a weapon to stop people who are trying to kill you. Often deployed by police officers using riot shields or ASP batons, it’s just as effective with a chair leg.
  - **Cover the Angles** (1): Whenever you take a Dodge action, reduce the Defense penalties for multiple attackers by 1. You can apply your full Defense against the first two attacks, suffer a –1 penalty against the third, and so on.
  - **Weak Spot** (2): You swing against your opponent’s arm rather than his own weapon. Use this ability when defending against an armed attacker. If your Defense reduces his attack pool to 0, he’s disarmed.
  - **Aggressive Defense** (3): Anyone dumb enough to come near you is liable to get hurt. When you take a Dodge action, if attacker miss you, you deal one point of lethal damage to the attacker per extra success. Your weapon bonus doesn’t apply to this extra damage. You cannot combine this maneuver with Press the Advantage or Weak Spot.
  - **Iron Guard** (4): You and your weapon are one. At the start of each turn, you can choose to reduce your weapon bonus (down to a minimum of 0) to increase your Defense by a like amount.
  - **Press the Advantage** (5): You create an opening with a block and lash out with a fist or foot. When you’re taking a Dodge action, if your attacker miss, you can make an unarmed attack against that opponent at a −2 penalty. Your opponent applies Defense as normal. You can only make one attack per turn in this way.
- **Cheap Shot** (2)
Prerequisites: Street Fighting 3, Subterfuge 2
Effect: Your character is a master at the bait and switch. She can look off in an odd direction and prompt her opponent to do the same, or she might step on someone’s toes to distract them. Either way, she fights dirty. Make a Dexterity + Subterfuge roll as a reflexive action. The opponent’s player contests with Wits + Composure. If you score more successes, the opponent loses his Defense for the next turn. Each time a character uses this maneuver in a scene, it levies a cumulative -2 penalty to further uses as the opposition gets used to the tricks.
- **Choke Hold** (2)
Prerequisites: Brawl 2
Effect: If you can get your hands on someone, it’s over. When grappling, you can use the Choke move: If you rolled more successes than twice the victim’s Stamina, he’s unconscious for (six - Stamina) minutes. You must first have succeeded at a Hold move. If you don’t score enough successes at first, you can Choke your opponent on future turns and total your successes.
- **Close Quarters Combat** (1 to 5)
Prerequisites: Wits 3, Athletics 2, Brawl 3
Effect: You know that hitting someone in the face is an easy way to break the little bones in your hand. To that end, you’ve perfected the art of using the environment to hurt people.
  - **Firing Lines** (1): In some situations, your best option is a tactical retreat — especially if you’ve inadvertently brought a knife to a shooting contest. You can run for cover as a reaction to a ranged attack. You give up your action for the turn but can get to any cover that’s within twice your Speed.
  - **Hard Surfaces** (2): Bouncing someone’s head off a wood log, table, or a wall is a handy way to increase the amount of hurt inflicted while not breaking the aforementioned hand bones. When you’re grappling someone, you can bounce them off a hard surface with a Damage move. You deal lethal damage and immediately end the grapple.
  - **Armored Coffin** (3): The problem with protection is simple: the very things that protect you can be turned against you. That holds true for body armor just as much as anything else. Sure, it blocks arrows and knives, but get in a clinch and you might as well be wearing a straightjacket. When you grapple an opponent, add their general armor rating to your dice pool. When you use a Damage move, ignore your opponent’s armor. This technique can’t be used in conjunction with Hard Surfaces.
  - **Prep Work** (4): If you’ve got a second to look around, you could catch someone by surprise almost anywhere. When launching a surprise attack, your Dexterity + Stealth roll becomes a rote action (reroll any failure dice once). Your ambush must use Brawl or Weaponry.
- **Duelist** (1 to 4)
Prerequisites: Dexterity 3 and Weaponry 3
Effect: Your character has trained to fight with a weapon in both hands. Your character still suffers the -2 offhand penalty when attacking with a weapon in his secondary hand.
  - **Whirling Blades** (1): Your character’s Dodge is not penalized by multiple attacks staged against him in a turn until the number of attacks exceeds his Weaponry.
  - **Deflect and Thrust** (2): Your character can avoid attacks and strike back in the same motion. Your character can gain +2 to his Defense for the turn, but any attack he makes suffers a -2 penalty. He can move no more than his Speed while performing a Deflect and Thrust maneuver in a turn.
  - **Focused Attack** (3): Your character can attack a single target twice in one turn. The second attack suffers a -1 penalty. Your character cannot use his Defense against any attack in the same turn he use this maneuver.
  - **Fluid Attack** (4): Your character can make a single attack on two different targets in one turn. The targets cannot be a distance apart in excess of your Character’s Speed trait. The second attack suffers a -1 penalty. Your character cannot use his Defense against any attack in the same turn he use this maneuver.
  - **Turnabout** (5): If you’re caught short in a fight, your opponent’s weapon suits you just fine. When you attempt to Disarm your opponent, step the results up one level — on a failure, your opponent drops the weapon. On a success, you take possession of your opponent’s weapon. On an exceptional success, you’ve got the weapon and your opponent takes two points of bashing damage.
- **Defensive Combat** (1)
Prerequisite: Brawl 1 or Weaponry 1; choose one.
Effect: You are training in avoiding damage in combat. Use your Brawl or Weaponry to calculate Defense rather than Athletics. You cannot use Weaponry to calculate Defense unless you actually have a weapon in hand.
- **Fighting Finesse** (2)
Prerequisites: Dexterity 3, a Specialty in Weaponry or Brawl
Effect: You may substitute your character’s Dexterity for her Strength when making rolls with that Specialty.
- **Grappling** (1 to 5)
Prerequisites: Stamina 3, Strength 2, Athletics 2, Brawl 2
Effect: Your character has trained in wrestling or one of grappling martial arts.
  - **Sprawl** (1): Your character can adjust her weight to defend herself in a grapple. While in a grapple, the character’s opponent cannot apply the Drop Prone or Take Cover moves.
  - **Takedown** (2): Your character can take an opponent to the ground rapidly. With a normal roll, you may choose to render an opponent prone instead of establishing a grapple. You may also choose to cause bashing damage equal to the successes rolled.
  - **Joint Lock** (3): You use joint locks and immobilizing tactics to limit your opponent’s movement. You can use the Joint Lock move in a grapple. Next turn, your opponent suffers bashing damage equal to your successes. You can use Joint Lock as a lead-in to the Restrain move. In addition, any successful overpowering maneuvers your character uses cause 1L damage in addition to their normal effects.
- **Guard Tactics** (1 to 3)
Prerequisites: Brawl 2, Weaponry 1
Effect: Your character is trained in restraint techniques.
  - **Compliance Hold** (1): Once your character has established a Hold in a grapple, your opponent suffers a -3 to all further grappling rolls until your character releases her.
  - **Weapon Retention** (2): Opponents attempting to disarm your character or turn her weapon against her must exceed your character’s Weaponry score in successes.
  - **Speed Cuff** (3): Against an immobilized opponent, your character may apply handcuffs, cable ties, or similar restraints as a reflexive action.
- **Improvised Weaponry** (1 to 3)
Prerequisites: Wits 3, Weaponry 1
You’re good at making do with what you’ve got. You’ve got something almost like a sixth sense for weaponry and can find one almost anywhere.
  - **Always Armed** (1): You can always get your hands on something dangerous, and you’ve an instinctive understanding of how to put it to good — and deadly — use. At the start of your turn, make a reflexive Wits + Weaponry roll to grab an object suitable for use as a weapon in pretty much any environment. Regardless of what you pick up, the weapon has a +1 Damage and Size 1. On an exceptional success, get a +2 Damage, Size 2 weapon. Whatever you grab doesn’t suffer the normal −1 penalty for wielding an improvised weapon.
  - **In Harm’s Way** (2): You’ve got a knack for putting your weapon in the way of an oncoming attack, no matter how small or inappropriate for blocking it might be. While wielding an improvised weapon acquired with Always Armed, you can add it’s Size as Defense against a single Brawl or Weaponry attack. Any damage you take inflicts an equal amount of damage to the improvised weapon, bypassing Durability.
  - **Breaking Point** (3): One sure way to win a fight is to hit the other guy so hard that he doesn’t get back up, even if that means losing a weapon in the process. When making an all-out attack with an improvised weapon acquired with Always Armed, you can reduce the weapon’s Structure by any amount down to zero. Every two points of Structure spent in this way adds +1 Damage for that one single attack. Declare any Structure loss before making the attack; this Structure is reduced even if the attack does no damage. If the weapon is reduced to zero Structure, it is automatically destroyed after the attack. You can use this technique in conjunction with In Harm’s Way, allowing you to parry an attack made on a higher Initiative and then go on the offensive, provided that the weapon wasn’t destroyed.
- **Iron Skin** (2 or 4)
Prerequisites: Martial Arts 2 or Street Fighting 2, Stamina 3
Effect: Through rigorous conditioning or extensive scarring, your character has grown resistant to harm. She can shrug off shots that would topple bigger fighters. She knows how to take a strike and can even move into a hit from a weapon to minimize harm. She gains armor against bashing attacks; one point of armor with 2 dots, and two points of armor with 4 dots. By spending a point of Willpower when hit, she can downgrade lethal damage from a successful attack into bashing. Downgrade one point of lethal damage at 2 dots, two points of lethal with 4 dots.
- **Martial Arts** (1 to 5)
Prerequisites: Resolve 3, Dexterity 3, Athletics 2, Brawl 2
Effect: Your character is trained in one or more formal martial arts styles. These maneuvers may only be used unarmed, or with weapons capable of using the Brawl Skill, such as a punch dagger, or a weapon using the Shiv Merit.
  - **Focused Attack** (1): Your character has trained extensively in striking specific parts of an opponent’s body. Reduce penalties for hitting specific targets by one. Additionally, you may ignore one point of armor on any opponent.
  - **Defensive Strike** (2): Your character excels in defending herself while finding the best time to strike. You can add one or two points to your character’s Defense. For each Defense point you take, subtract a die from any attacks you make. This can only be used in a turn in which your character intends to attack. It cannot be used with a Dodge.
  - **Whirlwind Strike** (3): When engaged, your character becomes a storm of threatening kicks and punches; nothing close is safe. As long as your character has her Defense available to her and is not Dodging, any character coming into arm’s reach takes 1B damage. This damage continues once per turn as long as the enemy stays within range and occurs on the enemy’s turn. If you spend a point of Willpower, this damage becomes 2B until your next turn.
  - **The Hand as Weapon** (4): With this degree of training, your character’s limbs are hardened to cause massive trauma. Her unarmed strikes cause lethal damage.
  - **The Touch of Death** (5): Your character’s mastery has brought with it the daunting power of causing lethal injury with a touch. If she chooses, her unarmed strikes count as weapons 2 damage rating.
- **Shiv** (1 or 2)
Prerequisites: Street Fighting 2, Weaponry 1
Effect: Your character carries small, concealable weapons for use in a tussle. Rolls to detect the concealed weapon suffer your character’s Weaponry score as a penalty. With the one dot version, she can conceal a weapon with a 1 damage rating. The two-dot version can conceal a 2 damage rating weapon. Your character may use the Brawl Skill to use this weapon.
- **Street Fighting** (1 to 5)
Prerequisites: Stamina 3, Composure 3, Brawl 2, Streetwise 2
Effect: Your character learned to fight on the mean streets. She may have had some degree of formal training, but the methodology came from the real world in dangerous circumstances. Street Fighting isn’t about form and grace. It’s about staying alive. These maneuvers may only be used unarmed, with weapons capable of using the Brawl Skill, or weapons using the Shiv Merit.
  - **Duck and Weave** (1): Your character has been beaten all to hell more than a few times. Now she dodges on instinct, not on skill. You can reflexively take a one-die penalty to any actions this turn in order to use the higher of her Wits and Dexterity to calculate Defense. If you’ve already made a roll without penalty this turn, you cannot use Duck and Weave.
  - **Knocking the Wind Out** (2): Shots to the center mass can shake an opponent, and your character knows this well. When your character makes a successful unarmed attack, the opponent suffers a -1 to his next roll.
  - **Kick ‘Em While They’re Down** (3): The best enemy is one on the ground. Your character topples opponents and keeps them down. Any time your successes on an attack roll exceed an opponent’s Stamina, you may choose to apply the Knocked Down Tilt. Additionally, any time your character is close enough to strike when an opponent attempts to get up from a prone position, she can reflexively cause 2B damage.
  - **One-Two Punch** (4): Your character hits fast and follows through with every hit. Whenever she makes a successful attack, you can spend a point of Willpower to cause two extra points of bashing damage.
  - **Last-Ditch Effort** (5): In a street fight, every second could be the one that kills you. A proficient street fighter is a remarkable survivalist. She bites, headbutts, trips: whatever it takes to prevent that last hit. Any time a character with this level of Street Fighting is about to take a hit or an overpowering maneuver when she’s already suffering wound penalties, she can reflexively spend a Willpower point and sacrifice her Defense for the turn to make an attack against her would-be assailant. This can occur even if she’s already acted in a turn, so long as she’s not already spent Willpower. Resolve this attack before the opponent’s action.
