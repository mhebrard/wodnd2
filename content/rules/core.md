# Core Rules

## Players, d10 and Rolls.

In a role-playing game (RPG), one person drives the storytelling, the Game Master (GM). They describe the situation and controls the Non-Player Characters (NPC). Each other player controls one character (PC). A character is described by various Attributes, Skills, and other Traits. Those Traits are rated by Dots, from 1 to 5 for the majority. The game requires 10-sided dice (d10). When a character wishes to perform an action with an uncertain outcome, the player must roll a pull of dice corresponding to the character's ability to perform the action. The result of the roll determines if the task succeeds or fails. In normal conditions, a player roll a number of dices equal to the number of Dots in one Attribute + one Skill (#d10). Each dice with a result of 8, 9 or 10 (8+) represent a success. In case of 10, the dice counts as one success and the player rolls it one more time (10-Again). The new result is added to the pull.

## Experience Point

At the end of a game session, the Game Master awarded Experience Points (XP) to each character regarding their achievements during the session. These points can be spent to purchase new Traits. See below for costs:

- **Attribute**: New dots x 5
- **Skill**: New dots x 3
- **Specialty**: 3
- **Merit**: New dots x 2
- **Mastery**: New dots x 7
- **Major Path**: New dots x 5
- **Minor Path**: New dots x 6

Note that you must spend XP for all levels you need to acquire.

The GM can award experience points prior of a campaign:
- **Seasoned characters**: 35 XP
- **Expert characters**: 75 XP
- **Heroic characters**: 100 XP

## Exceptional Success, Chance Roll and Dramatic Failure

When 5 or more successes are obtained in one roll, an “exceptional success” occurs that triggers an additional positive effect to the action. If for a specific action the dice pull is reduced to zero, the player can yet try his chance. He rolls a unique dice but only a 10 means success. However, if the result is 1, a “dramatic failure” occurs and the character will suffer a disastrous setback.

## Instant, Extended, Contested and Reflexive Action.

An instant action takes place in a timescale of 3 seconds (Turn), is resolved by a unique roll and needs a unique success to be achieved. An Extended Action needs more time to be completed, and multiple successes can be needed. Players can perform multiple rolls until the number of successes is reached. Keep in mind that each new roll represents time spent on the same action (from 5 min to a whole day regarding the Action). A Contested Action involves two characters or more than competing with each other to accomplish the same Action (that can be Instant or Extended). Finally, a Reflexive Action takes place in no time and does not prevent the character from performing another action in the same time-lapse.
