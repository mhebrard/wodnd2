# Magic

## Casting Spells
Magic in WoDnD2 is dangerous and powerful. To cast a spell, roll **Gnosis + Arcanum**.

## Arcana
There are 10 Arcana governing different aspects of reality:
- **Death**: Ghosts, decay, shadows.
- **Fate**: Luck, destiny, oaths.
- **Forces**: Fire, electricity, physics.
- **Life**: Healing, disease, beasts.
- **Matter**: Alchemy, transmutation.
- **Mind**: Telepathy, illusions.
- **Prime**: Mana, magic itself.
- **Space**: Teleportation, scrying.
- **Spirit**: Spirits, the Gauntlet.
- **Time**: Prophecy, time manipulation.

## Paradox
If you push magic too far, reality pushes back. Rolling a failure on a risky spell can cause a Paradox, dealing damage or creating wild anomalies.
