# Magic

Magic is divided in 7 Paths that work in tandem, Air is opposed to Earth, Fire is opposed to Water, Evil is opposed to Holy and then the last path is Mind. To learn how to use these forces, the character must find a master and buy the Merit Initiate that gives him 3 dots to spend in paths. The paths of each tandem where the character is the most trained (more dots) becomes the major path, and its tandem becomes minor (Mind is always minor). Mastery reflects the potency to use Magi and Mana is the fuel. A character starts with 1 dot in Mastery. A Path cannot exceed Mastery +1 dots. When he becomes Initiate, he learns how to gather Mana with a maximum of 9 dots + Mastery. Each spell needs 1 Mana to be cast. The caster roll Mastery + Path. Additional effects can be requested (see M.p118). Additional Mana spend gives a +1 dice per Mana. A character can spend a number of Mana per turn equal to his Mastery. All Mana dots are restored after one night of sleep or by meditation at a rate of 1 dot per hour.
