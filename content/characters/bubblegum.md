# Bubblegum

![Bubblegum](/images/demon-hunter/Bubblegum_v2_Sword.png)

## Story

- Bubblegum first mission as a Hunter Idol was to protect the Seoul Pop Palooza festival.

## Creation

### Initial Attributes Reasoning

- Primary: Social (1 Base + 5 additional dots)
  - Presence: 4 - She commands the stage and the battlefield.
  - Manipulation: 2 - She can influence fans or trick demons.
  - Composure: 2 - She generally keeps her cool, though she is still young.
- Secondary: Physical (1 Base + 5 additional dots)
  - Strength: 2 - Just enough muscle to swing her staff effectively.
  - Dexterity: 4 - Exceptional agility for intricate choreography and dodging attacks.
  - Stamina: 1 - She is physically fragile; she relies on not getting hit.
- Tertiary: Mental (1 Base + 3 additional dots)
  - Intelligence: 1 - She relies more on instinct and talent than book learning.
  - Wits: 3 - High reaction time is critical for a hunter.
  - Resolve: 2 - She is dedicated to her craft.

### Initial Skills Reasoning

- Primary: Social (11 dots)
  - Animal Ken: 1 - She loves animals and has a natural affinity for them, perhaps owning a popular pet that appears on her social media.
  - Empathy: 2 - She is good at understanding her fans' emotions and "reading the room" during interviews or investigations.
  - Expression: 5 - As an Idol, she is a master performer. *Specialty: Singing*
  - Socialize: 2 - She knows how to behave at parties and fan meets, though she relies more on her performance (Expression) and intuition (Empathy) than navigating complex social hierarchies.
- Secondary: Physical (7 dots)
  - Athletics: 3 - Endurance for concerts and agility for hunting. This supports her "Dodge" and movement speed. *Specialty: Acrobatics* (both stage choreography and dodging demon attacks).
  - Stealth: 1 - She has just enough training to hide from paparazzi or sneak up on a distracted demon, but she isn't a ninja.
  - Weaponry: 3 - She is professional-level trained with her magical staff. *Specialty: Sword*.
- Tertiary: Mental (4 dots)
  - Investigation: 1 - She can spot a clue if it's obvious, but she isn't a detective.
  - Medicine: 1 - Basic first aid. Idol training often includes how to treat minor sprains or exhaustion.
  - Occult: 2 - She knows the lore of the things she hunts. She knows the difference between a vampire and a werewolf and their basic weaknesses.

### Initial Merits Reasoning

- Fame: 1 - Rookie Idol, She is famous, but not too famous.
- Fighting Finesse: 2 - Use Dexterity to attack with her sword
- Fleet to Foot: 1 - +1 Speed
- Initiate: 1 - Unlock magic and give 3 dots in paths
- Quick draw: 1 - Invoke her sword instantly
- Resource: 2 - She is supported by her Idol agency - middle-class income

### Initial Magic Reasoning

- Fire: (2) Create Candle Flame - 1L: This allows her to create energy. We flavor this "flame" as electric sparks or a "lightning aura" on her sword that deals +1 Lethal damage.
- Air: (1) Control the Blow: She controls air currents. We flavor this as wind whipping around her to reduce drag.

### Initial Equipment

- Mic Katana: Her microphone is her Hunter Idol magic focus. When in need to fight demons, she can invoke a katana blade from the tail of the mic.
- Reinforced Stage Gear: Her agency provide reinforced stage gear (equivalent to leather armor).

### Class Equivalent

In term of class, Bubblegum is equivalent to a Bard from the College of Swords.
